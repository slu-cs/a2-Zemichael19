CS332 Assignment #2

Citations: I worked with Arman, Peixuan and Xin on this assignment.
https://kb.objectrocket.com/mongo-db/mongoose-partial-text-search-606 - I used this site to set up the general election question. It allowed me to find GE16 as a substring in the history string. 

I also used the mongoose api documentation for most of the methods used in the query.

I also got help from Dr. Torrey on setting up my create file.
